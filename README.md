# AudioMuse-AI on AMD GPUs

AMD GPU acceleration for [AudioMuse-AI](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI):
musicnn and the CLAP audio encoder on the GPU via ONNX Runtime's MIGraphX
provider, and lyrics transcription on faster-whisper.

**Two pieces, and you need both:**

| | What                                                      | Why |
| --- |-----------------------------------------------------------| --- |
| **Worker image** | `ghcr.io/schaka/audiomuse-ai-rocm:7.14-<arch>`            | AudioMuse-AI's published image rebuilt on a ROCm base, with a MIGraphX-enabled onnxruntime and CTranslate2's ROCm build |
| **Plugin** | `ROCm Accelerator (AMD)`, installed from the Plugins page | Wires those into the analysis pipeline |

A plugin cannot install a ROCm stack (a PyPI `onnxruntime` would replace the
MIGraphX build with a CPU-only one), so the runtime has to come from the image.
On any other image the plugin registers nothing.

Requires AudioMuse-AI **3.1.0 or newer**.

## 1. Pick your image

```bash
rocminfo | grep gfx
```

One tag per arch — several arches' ROCm kernels do not fit in one image.

| Tag | GPUs |
| --- | --- |
| `latest-gfx1201`, `-gfx1200` | RDNA4 (RX 9070 …) — `gfx1201` validated on RX 9070 XT |
| `latest-gfx1100`, `-gfx1101`, `-gfx1102`, `-gfx1103` | RDNA3 (RX 7000, RDNA3 APUs) |
| `latest-gfx1150`, `-gfx1151`, `-gfx1152`, `-gfx1153` | Phoenix / Strix / Strix Halo APUs |
| `latest-gfx1030`, `-gfx1031`, `-gfx1032`, `-gfx1034`, `-gfx1035`, `-gfx1036` | RDNA2 (RX 6000, RDNA2 APUs) — not `gfx1033` (Steam Deck): no `rocm7.14-gfx1033` base image upstream. `gfx1031` validated on Sapphire GPRO X080 (RX 6700 equivalent) |
| `latest-gfx1010`, `-gfx1011`, `-gfx1012` | RDNA1 (RX 5000) — `gfx1010` validated on RX 5700 XT |
| `latest-gfx900`, `-gfx90c`, `-gfx906`, `-gfx908`, `-gfx90a`, `-gfx942`, `-gfx950` | Vega / CDNA |
| `latest-gfx803` | Polaris (RX 460–590) — experimental, see [docs/ARCH_NOTES.md](docs/ARCH_NOTES.md). `gfx806` (RX 470 8GB UEFI Mining) also validated, runs under this tag |

`latest-gfx803` moved onto the ROCm 7.14 base as of plugin **1.1** — the
same base every other arch already used. If you'd rather stay on the older
ROCm 6.4.4 gfx803 base (for stability, or any other reason), pin the plugin
to **1.0.1**, the last version built against it; 1.1+ assumes the 7.14
worker image and is not tested against the 6.4.4 one.

Also published: `:<version>-<arch>` pinned to an upstream AudioMuse-AI
release (e.g. `:3.1.0-gfx1030`), for locking your worker to a specific
upstream version instead of tracking `latest`. Unrelated to the plugin's own
version — the plugin never ships inside this image. `:unstable-<arch>` /
`:unstable-<YYYYMMDD>-<arch>` are built nightly against upstream's `:devel`.

## 2. Wire it into your compose file

If you already run upstream's
[`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI/blob/main/deployment/docker-compose.yaml),
the change is: swap the worker's image, pass through the GPU, and mount a
cache volume. Nothing else in your existing stack needs to move.

```yaml
  audiomuse-ai-worker:
    image: ghcr.io/schaka/audiomuse-ai-rocm:latest-gfx1030  # <- your arch from step 1
    container_name: audiomuse-ai-worker-instance
    devices:
      - /dev/kfd
      - /dev/dri
    # image ships no render/video group; pass the host's numeric GIDs
    # (getent group render video)
    group_add:
      - "105"
      - "39"
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
      - label=disable   # SELinux hosts (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS) - see below
    ipc: host
    volumes:
      - migraphx-cache:/app/.cache/migraphx
      - miopen-cache:/app/.cache/miopen
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **On an SELinux-enforcing host (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS) `label=disable` is not
> optional.** `/dev/kfd` is labelled `hsa_device_t`, and the stock container
> policy has no rule permitting a container to `mmap` it — the
> `container_use_dri_devices` rule that covers `/dev/dri` does not extend to
> it. Open and ioctl *are* permitted, so the GPU is detected and models begin
> compiling; only libhsakmt's HDP-flush MMIO page fails to map, and the worker
> then dies mid-compile with `SIGABRT` (exit 134):
>
> ```
> Failed to map remapped mmio page on gpu_mem 0
> Memory critical error by agent node-0 (Agent handle: 0x…) on address 0x…. Reason: Memory in use.
> ```
>
> Every album then fails and retries forever. If you would rather keep the
> container SELinux-confined, the narrower fix is to leave `label=disable` out
> and have an administrator enable the `container_use_devices` boolean instead,
> which grants containers device-node access system-wide. On hosts where
> SELinux is not enforcing, `label=disable` changes nothing.
>
> **podman-compose users:** do not rely on `ipc: host` to cover this.
> podman-compose (1.6.0 and earlier) does not implement the compose `ipc:` key
> at all — it is parsed and silently dropped, so the container gets podman's
> default. It happens to mask the SELinux problem when it *is* applied, because
> sharing a host namespace makes podman drop label separation as a side effect;
> that is a coincidence, not the mechanism. `security_opt` is honoured.

The two cache volumes hold MIGraphX's and MIOpen's compiled-kernel caches. See
[MIGraphX cache details](plugin/rocm_accelerator/README.md#compiled-model-cache)
for why it's split into `fp16`/`fp32` subdirectories internally.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The first analysis is slow — this is expected, not a hang or a crash.**
> MIGraphX has to compile musicnn/CLAP for your GPU's arch before it can run
> them. That compile can take anywhere from several minutes to **over an
> hour**, during which the log repeats `WARN`/error-looking lines between
> `Model Compile: Begin` and `Model Compile: End` — those are normal compiler
> chatter, not failures. Let it run; once `Model Compile: End` shows up,
> inference is fast for the rest of your library. `fp16_enable` is a knob you
> can try either way — whether fp16 or fp32 compiles faster or infers faster
> is not a fixed rule, it depends on arch and model (MIGraphX has open
> upstream issues where fp16 ends up *slower* than fp32:
> [#763](https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/issues/763),
> [#4170](https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/issues/4170)). Check
> [ARCH_NOTES.md](docs/ARCH_NOTES.md) for what's actually been measured on
> your GPU generation before assuming either direction.
>
> Recompiles happen again whenever MIGraphX sees a graph shape it hasn't
> cached yet — inputs are fixed-size per model, so this isn't per-track, but
> it can happen after toggling `fp16_enable`, or on a fresh container without
> the cache volumes mounted (a restart with no volume wipes everything and
> forces every model to compile from scratch again). Mounting
> `migraphx-cache`/`miopen-cache` as shown above is what makes that a one-time
> cost instead of a recurring one.

A complete stack — Postgres, Redis, both services, GPU passthrough, group ids,
cache volumes — is at
[`examples/docker-compose.yaml`](examples/docker-compose.yaml), written as a
direct diff against upstream's own compose file so it's clear exactly what
changed. Copy it, replace the arch in both `image:` lines, fill in your media
server, `docker compose up -d`.

## 3. Configure the plugin

Settings, environment variables and the compiled-model cache layout are
documented in the
[plugin README](plugin/rocm_accelerator/README.md#settings) — edit them from
**Plugins → ROCm Accelerator (AMD) → Settings** in the UI, which opens a raw
JSON editor for the whole settings object.

## 4. Get the plugin

Two routes, publishing the same plugin id — **use one, not both** (an
unstable build sorts above the stable release it was built from).

### Community catalog (recommended)

Listed in the
[community catalog](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI-plugins), which
AudioMuse-AI ships as a repository out of the box — nothing to add, install
**AMD GPU Hardware Acceleration** straight from the Catalog tab. Stable
releases only.

### This repository's own catalog

Only needed for the unstable channel, which the community catalog does not
carry. Published as GitHub release assets — there is no server behind it.

```
# stable, tracks the latest release
https://github.com/Schaka/audiomuse-rocm-plugin/releases/latest/download/repository.json

# unstable: rebuilt from main on every plugin change, untested
https://github.com/Schaka/audiomuse-rocm-plugin/releases/download/unstable/repository.json
```

Add it in **Plugins → Repositories**, refresh the catalog, install **ROCm
Accelerator (AMD)** from the Catalog tab, apply the restart.

Replacing the community catalog entirely (rather than adding to it) is possible
with `PLUGIN_DEFAULT_REPO_URL`, but then no other community plugin is
installable. Adding a repository in the UI is the better option.

**Check it worked:** the worker log should show a MIGraphX provider chain for
musicnn and faster-whisper for lyrics; `rocm-smi` on the host should show the
worker using the GPU during an analysis.

## Documentation

- [Plugin behavior, settings and environment](plugin/rocm_accelerator/README.md)
- [Per-arch findings](docs/ARCH_NOTES.md) — what was measured on which GPU, and
  why the plugin behaves differently there
- [Adding an arch profile](docs/ARCH_PROFILES.md) — wiring in behavior for a GPU
  generation that needs it

## Development

Building the image or plugin from source, running the test suite, iterating
against a working tree or an unreleased core: see
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Releases

Nothing in this repo is written back by CI — the catalog is built from release
assets, so no workflow can retrigger itself.

| Workflow | Trigger | Publishes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugin-release.yml` | `v*` tag here | Release with the plugin zip, `plugin.json`, `repository.json` |
| `plugin-unstable.yml` | push to `main` touching `plugin/**` | Rolling `unstable` prerelease, same three assets |
| `image-stable.yml` | poll, every 30 min | `:<version>-<arch>` + `:latest-<arch>` when upstream cuts a release |
| `image-unstable.yml` | poll, nightly | `:unstable-<arch>` when upstream's `:devel` digest changes |

The image workflows poll because a push in a repository we do not own cannot
trigger a workflow here. Both keep their "last built against" marker in the
Actions cache, keyed on the upstream digest or version.

## Base images

The ROCm bases come from
[Schaka/rocm-migraphx-ort-builder](https://github.com/Schaka/rocm-migraphx-ort-builder):
`rocm-migraphx-ort-torch-builder:rocm7.14-<arch>`, one tag per arch. gfx803
(Polaris) is the exception - ROCm 7 dropped Polaris support outright, so its
`rocm7.14-gfx803` tag is published by a separate repo,
[Schaka/rocm-gfx803](https://github.com/Schaka/rocm-gfx803), which carries a
from-source ROCR-Runtime/CLR rebuild restoring enumeration for it. Same
package, same tag scheme either way - this repo's workflow doesn't need to
know which upstream repo actually built a given arch's tag. `gfx1033` (Steam
Deck) has no `rocm7.14-gfx1033` base image at all, so it is dropped from the
build matrix here.
