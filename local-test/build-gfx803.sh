# Build and run the whole local stack for a Polaris / gfx803 test system.
#
# Wraps the two compose files with the gfx803-specific bits filled in: the
# gfx803 base image tag and the host's render/video GIDs, which have to be
# passed numerically because the base image has no matching groups.
#
# Core is built from source by default, since the published core image does not
# have the plugin seams yet.
#
# Usage:
#   local-test/build-gfx803.sh                 # build core + images, then start
#   local-test/build-gfx803.sh --build-only    # build everything, start nothing
#   SKIP_CORE=1 local-test/build-gfx803.sh     # reuse the core image already built
#   AUDIOMUSE_CONTEXT=../../AudioMuse-AI local-test/build-gfx803.sh
